I absolutely love to learn new things. Whether it’s something to advance my career (scrum master training), personal development (blogging), or just a fun hobby (motorcycling).
But, sometimes I seem to somewhat suffer from Imposter Syndrome. Especially at work or when listening to technical talks. I can’t help but have the feeling that I’m lacking knowledge and that I don’t know nearly enough to properly do my job.</description>

These days the Rust programming language seems to be everywhere you go online. In fact, the Rust language was rated as one of the most loved languages by the community in the 2020 StackOverflow developer survey!
I often tend to stay away from hypes and new languages, but the amount of engineers praising Rust has grown significantly over the years. So much that I just had to check it out myself!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Tahar! Looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon my little hideout on the internet&amp;hellip;
This page is pretty boring summary of who I am and where I work. Not the most exciting stuff, but I figured you might like to know a little bit more about who&amp;rsquo;s responsible for all the nonsense on this website. 😅
A little bit about me&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed as a software engineer at Deloitte&amp;rsquo;s cloud engineering team in Amsterdam.</description>
