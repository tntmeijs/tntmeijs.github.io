I'm Tahar! Looks like you've stumbled upon my little hideout on the internet...

This page is pretty boring summary of who I am and where I work. Not the most exciting stuff, but I figured you might like to
know a little bit more about who's responsible for all the nonsense on this website. ðŸ˜…

A little bit about me... I'm currently employed as a software engineer at
[Deloitte's cloud engineering](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/strategy-operations/solutions/cloud-engineering.html)
team in Amsterdam. Before joining Deloitte, I was employed as a game developer at
[Sumo Digital](https://www.sumo-digital.com/), where I worked on
[Sackboy: A Big Adventure](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/sackboy-a-big-adventure/) for PlayStation 4 and 5. It's a
brilliant little game. If you happen to have a PlayStation 5 console, I'd highly recommend grabbing yourself a copy. It's great
fun and you might even spot my name in the credits! ðŸ˜‰

Nowadays I mainly work on microservices using Java, Kafka, and Spring Boot. It may not sound as exciting as game development,
but to me it's just as fun as working on games!

In my spare time I absolutely *love* to mess around with silly little side projects and random experiments. This allows me to
learn new technologies and discover cool things I might not be able to do at work because they're... well... useless! ðŸ¤£

This website is a way for me to share my fun side projects with the world. If you're into that stuff, be sure to check back
regularly. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tntmeijs/) if some of my projects have piqued your
interest. I'm always up for a (virtual) coffee chat! â˜•

Anyway, enough rambling for now! Thanks a bunch for checking out my blog, I appreciate it a lot. I hope you'll enjoy the
content on this website as much as I loved writing it.

Cheers,

Tahar
