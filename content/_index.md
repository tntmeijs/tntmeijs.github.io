title: Hey!
---
My name's Tahar - welcome to my little corner on the internet. :)

I'm currently employed as a software engineer at Deloitte's Cloud Engineering team in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Most of my work involves Java, Spring Boot, and Kafka.

However, in my spare time I absolutely *love* to mess around with silly little side projects such as a [path tracer](https://github.com/tntmeijs/TraceSharp), [Chip-8 emulator](https://github.com/tntmeijs/Chip8), or even a [search engine](https://github.com/tntmeijs/SearchEngine)!

Some of my friends and colleagues have expressed interest in what I do, which is why I finally decided to stop postponing the inevitable and just launch this blog!

If you're curious to see what I'm doing, learning, and experimenting with, make sure to bookmark this page and check back every now and then.

Cheers!
